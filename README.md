## Background
In computer vision, object detection is crucial for identifying objects in images or videos and determining their locations. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the emergence of efficient algorithms like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN, widely used in applications such as autonomous driving, security monitoring, and industrial inspection.

Despite their effectiveness in research, practical applications face challenges:

Complex Configuration: Many algorithms require intricate parameter setups, raising usability barriers.
Dependency Management: Ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed across diverse environments can be time-consuming.
Model Deployment: Efficiently deploying and optimizing trained models in production often demands specialized knowledge.
This project aims to facilitate the rapid deployment of multiple object detection algorithms, allowing users to utilize them "out of the box." With a unified interface and streamlined installation process, users can easily select and switch between different algorithms without needing extensive knowledge of the underlying implementations, thereby lowering the entry barrier for using object detection technology in real-world scenarios.
